description: """
This library implements portable support for an operating system timesource
that is compatible with the [MirageOS](https://mirage.io) library interfaces
found in: <https://github.com/mirage/mirage>

It implements an `MCLOCK` module that represents a monotonic timesource
since an arbitrary point, and `PCLOCK` which counts time since the Unix
epoch.
